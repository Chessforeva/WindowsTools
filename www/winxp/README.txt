This is a Web server designed by ChatGPT
 especially for tcc  TinyC 32 bit compiler.
Another version is the same compiled on MS Visual C 2010.

It is for Windows XP.

Simply copy into old PC's folder. Start and it works.

www_xp.exe
www.ini
mimes.ini

Not advanced, nossl, no gzip transfers, just can get files.
For people holding good intentions.
Security starts with individual awareness.

This way can get old good things online.

----
Hack, but can help moving valuable family content.

Before starting the webserver, can run command prompt (Start cmd),
  move to current folder and run command
  dir *.* /s > content.txt

Now can see all the files and subfolders, read content.txt first.

Use inside the local network
  or configure router settings (ip,port) to allow access from outside.
 
It does not solve 2-byte unicode filenames in various languages,
 but files always can be renamed or zipped inside a download pack.

Modern Windows suspect TinyC executables as malwares and deletes. 
It is made for XP anyway.

= Notes about very old Windows possibilities.

If USB not working then...

If an old windows PC has internet possiblity, then first try set ip properties in networking.
Just specify an ip address, subnet 255.255.255.0 and it will run if not broken.
 *It may be limited to local network by the router to internet provider.
These are things that are still the same. Other physical devices as floppies, CDs, even USB things live and die.
So, try ethernet cable (if have one:) first. If green light flashes then may work.

Holding Shift+F8 when starting PC starts the Safe mode, as I remember.
Windows explorer and iexplorer could open ftp:// , http:// addresses.
So, can give the file by using a webserver.

Also Start>cmd.exe command prompt allows to start "ftp" as command.
ftp
ftp>open ip
ftp>get
...and enter download filename
ftp>put
...and upload a file

The "ipconfig" command gives current ip. It is the same from networking properties.
"ping ip" works, "tracert ip" also, can verify how internet responds.

So, can get this webserver, for example, or a zipper on an old PC.
Start and then go to newer Windows 11 to download files.

Various zip,7z,tar zippers will encapsulate files, especially with 2-byte filenames.
pkzip,pkunzip old tools, as I remember.

So, this way maybe some old good CDs could be shared ;).
Yee, music. Nero software made images from CDs. Or floppy games.
Just ideas.
