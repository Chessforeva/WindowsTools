Hack, but can help moving valuable family content.

Before starting the webserver, can run command prompt (Start cmd),
  move to current folder and run command
  dir *.* /s > content.txt

Now can see all the files and subfolders, read content.txt first.

Use inside the local network
  or configure router settings (ip,port) to allow access from outside.
